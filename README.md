# Case_Study_2_Google_Data_Analytics
I started the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification course from Coursera. In the last segment there was a capstone project which included two distinct case studies. It is the 2nd case study which involves the analysis of a smart device tracker data from Fitbits. I used the public dataset of FitBit Fitness Tracker Data from kaggle. The data and necessary informations can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit 
I would also like to thank Joe Yong, since during my completion of this case study I took help from the article of this guy. He did a neat job. His article is available in Medium. The article link is - https://medium.com/@joeanselmyz/google-data-analytics-case-study-2-using-rstudio-c4dba030365a I used R programming language during the analysis phase due to its robust features. Best of luck for everyone who is trying to learn data analytics from scratch like me.
